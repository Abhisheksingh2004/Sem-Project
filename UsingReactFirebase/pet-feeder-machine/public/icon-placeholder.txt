To fully support all devices, create the following icon files using your paw print design:

1. apple-touch-icon.png (180x180px) - For iOS home screen icons
2. icon-192.png (192x192px) - For Android home screen icons
3. icon-512.png (512x512px) - For PWA splash screens

These should match your favicon design but at larger sizes.

You can create these using any image editor or an online favicon generator service like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/ 
- https://favicon.io/

Use your current paw print SVG as the source, and they'll generate all the necessary sizes.
